# Matplotlib-Challenge
This is for the homework 5 of the bootcamp

This time we have the results of a study for different drugs. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens.

Within this challenge we will find different ways to build graphs and obtain data that is relevant to make decisions about the drugs administered.
